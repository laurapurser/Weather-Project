# Weather-Project
SheCodesPlus Weather App Project

I coded this project with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. I used the OpenWeather API for all the weather data. It includes current temperature, conditions, humidity level, windspeed and others, as well as a 5 day forecast. 
There's also an option to call the users current location using geolocation and show their weather and forecast.
